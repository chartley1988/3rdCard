            Dear Leah, <br>
            You always love to hear a good story, so let me tell you one. It began on my favorite holiday, Thanksgiving... This could be a lot of typing, maybe we should tell it with some pictures?
        </p>

            <p>This is my first photo of you. What a special day! You always have some great ideas, this was too much fun. I became addicted to your smile on this day.</p>

            <p>Remember this? It was your birthday! We took Dory for a walk in the rain at Sooke Potholes. Dory loved the puddles. I loved you.</p>

            <p>We tried to be classy this night. We pulled it off. Is this the night we said 'I love you'?</p>

            <p>I can't imagine a better way to get to know someone. You're such a big part of why I love climbing. Can't wait for us to get back out there!</p>

            <p>Haha, this is one of my favorites. It's one of your favorites too, I know it. What a great trip. One day I'll learn how to pose for a romantic photo!</p>

            <p>Victoria had a snowday... and we made the best of it by making a trashy snowman. I hope he's doing okay wherever he is.</p>

            <p>Bodega. From this day on, I've been completely sold on the elaborate art of eating cheese and drinking wine. I can never go back. Your surprise this week made me think of this day :).</p>

            <p>We kept climbing, because that's what we do. I like this one because it shows us as partners. You're such a badass!</p>
