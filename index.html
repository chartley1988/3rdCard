            Dear Leah, <br>
            You always love to hear a good story, so let me tell you one. It began on my favorite holiday, Thanksgiving... This could be a lot of typing, maybe we should tell it with some pictures?

            <p>This is my first photo of you. What a special day! You always have some great ideas, this was too much fun. I became addicted to your smile on this day.</p>

            <p>Remember this? It was your birthday! We took Dory for a walk in the rain at Sooke Potholes. Dory loved the puddles. I loved you.</p>

            <p>We tried to be classy this night. We pulled it off. Is this the night we said 'I love you'?</p>
